# Backup and Restore

StackState offers backup and restore functionality on different levels. StackState's configuration can be exported and imported separately from the stored, topology/telemetry data.

The following pages describe the process of backup and restore for different use cases:

* [File based backup/restore](file.md)
* [Configuration backup/restore](configuration.md)
* [Manual topology backup/restore](manual_topology.md)
