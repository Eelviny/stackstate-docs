StackState offers backup and restore functionality on different levels. StackState's configuration can be exported and imported separately from the stored, topology/telemetry data.

The following pages describe the process of backup and restore for different use cases:

* [File based backup/restore](/setup/backup_restore/file/)
* [Configuration backup/restore](/setup/backup_restore/configuration/)
* [Manual topology backup/restore](/setup/backup_restore/manual_topology/)
