StackState offers backup and restore functionality on different levels. StackState's configuration can be exported and imported separately from the stored, topology/telemetry data.

The following pages describe the process of backup and restore for different use cases:

* [File based backup/restore](https://github.com/mpvvliet/stackstate-docs/tree/0f69067c340456b272cfe50e249f4f4ee680f8d9/setup/backup_restore/file/README.md)
* [Configuration backup/restore](https://github.com/mpvvliet/stackstate-docs/tree/0f69067c340456b272cfe50e249f4f4ee680f8d9/setup/backup_restore/configuration/README.md)
* [Manual topology backup/restore](https://github.com/mpvvliet/stackstate-docs/tree/0f69067c340456b272cfe50e249f4f4ee680f8d9/setup/backup_restore/manual_topology/README.md)
