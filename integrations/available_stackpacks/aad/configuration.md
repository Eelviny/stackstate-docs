## Configuration

StackState's Autonomous Anomaly Detection doesn't need manual configuration. It automatically finds the right machine learning algorithm for each data stream using AutoML. This is a collection of anomaly detection algorithms, the semantics of the data, correlations among data streams, user feedback, and historical IT incidents. Autonomous Anomaly Detection tries different ways to detect anomalies and finds the one that detects the most meaningful anomalies making sure it doesn't have false positives.
