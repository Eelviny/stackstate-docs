## What is the ServiceNow StackPack?

The ServiceNow StackPack is used to create a near real time synchronization of CI's and their dependencies from ServiceNow to StackState.

To install this StackPack we need to know the instance id of your servicenow account.

## Prerequisites

* An API Integration Agent must be installed which can connect to ServiceNow and StackState. (See the [API Integration StackPack](/integrations/api-integration) for more details)
* A ServiceNow instance must be running.

## Enabling ServiceNow integration

To enable the ServiceNow check which collects the data from ServiceNow:

Edit the `servicenow.yaml` file in your agentâ€™s `conf.d` directory, replacing `<instance_ID>`, `<instance_username>` and `<instance_password>` with the information from your ServiceNow instance.
```
init_config:
  # Any global configurable parameters should be added here
  default_timeout: 10
  min_collection_interval: 5

instances:
  - url: "https://<instance_ID>.service-now.com"
    basic_auth:
       user: <instance_username>
       password: <instance_password>
    batch_size: 100
```

To enable the ServiceNow check restart the StackState Agent(s) using below command.

```
sudo /etc/init.d/stackstate-agent restart
```

Once the Agent is restarted, Wait for the Agent to collect the data and send it to StackState.
