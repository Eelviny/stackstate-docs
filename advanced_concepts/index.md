Each stack is unique. Modeling a stack therefore requires a lot of flexibility. StackState is a highly configurable and scriptable system that allows you to model your stack just the way it actually behaves. To understand how StackState does this one needs to dive deeper into the more advanced concepts of StackState:

* [Eventing](/advanced_concepts/eventing/)
* [Checks and Streams](/advanced_concepts/checks_and_streams/)
* [Propagation](/advanced_concepts/propagation/)
* [Synchronizations](/advanced_concepts/sync/)
* [View state](/advanced_concepts/view_state/)
