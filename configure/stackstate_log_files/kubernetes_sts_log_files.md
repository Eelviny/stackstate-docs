# StackState log files - Kubernetes



## How do I access the most recent logs?

```
kubectl logs
```


## Where are logs stored?

In a Kubernetes setup, StackState logs are stored across the running pods.


| Logs | Stored on pod | 
|:---|:---|
| Synchronization | stackstate-server |
| Data ingestion | stackstate-receiver |
| Data indexing into Elasticsearch | stackstate-mm2es (metrics)<br>stackstate-e2es (events)<br>stackstate-trace2es (traces)<br>stackstate-sts2es (events generated by StackState) |
| Checks | stackstate-server |
| State propagation | stackstate-server |
| View health state | stackstate-server |
| Event handlers | stackstate-server |
| API (including topology, charts and settings) | stackstate-server |


## Log aggregation

For long term storage of StackState log data, it is advised that you set up log aggregation on your Kubernetes cluster. This can be done using a third party system, such as Elasticsearch, Splunk or logz.io
