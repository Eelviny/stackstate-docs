### Script APIs:

All functionality that can be used through scripting is exposed via so-called script API's. These are singleton objects that contain a number of functions that can be called. Below follows a list of script API's:  

* [Topology - Accessing topology data](/develop/scripting/topology/)

* [Telemetry - Accessing telemetry data](/develop/scripting/telemetry/)

* [Http - Working with external HTTP services](/develop/scripting/http/)

* [Predictions - Functions for producing predictions](/develop/scripting/prediction/)

* [Component - Accessing component data](/develop/scripting/component/)

* [UI - Control the user-interface](/develop/scripting/ui/)

### Types:

 * [AsyncScriptResult - Working with asynchronous results](/develop/scripting/async_script_result)

 * [Instant / Duration - Time based types](/develop/scripting/time)
