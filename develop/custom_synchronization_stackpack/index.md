title: Custom Synchronization StackPack
kind: Documentation

The Custom Synchronization StackPack is a StackPack that is meant to ease the setup of a custom [topology synchronization](/configure/topology_synchronization). It works well with agent checks and can be a first step before making a StackPack.

### When to use the Custom Synchronization StackPack

The Custom Synchronization StackPack is meant for integrations that include a topology aspect. If your integration only has telemetry then you do not need this StackPack.

### How to use the Custom Synchronization StackPack

Refer to:

 * [How to connect your agent check to a StackState instance](/develop/custom_synchronization_stackpack/how_to_connect_agent_check_with_stackstate_instance/)
