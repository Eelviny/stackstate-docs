# index

The Custom Synchronization StackPack is a StackPack that is meant to ease the setup of a custom [topology synchronization](https://github.com/mpvvliet/stackstate-docs/tree/0f69067c340456b272cfe50e249f4f4ee680f8d9/configure/topology_synchronization/README.md). It works well with agent checks and can be a first step before making a StackPack.

## When to use the Custom Synchronization StackPack

The Custom Synchronization StackPack is meant for integrations that include a topology aspect. If your integration only has telemetry then you do not need this StackPack.
