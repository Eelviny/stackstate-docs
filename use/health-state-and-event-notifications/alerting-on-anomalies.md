## Overview

Autonomous Anomaly Detector (AAD) looks for anomalies in the IT environment and informs the user about possible issues by sending Anomaly Events.
The events are shown in the [event perspective](../../use/views/events_perspective.md).

In order to direct user attention to a proper part of IT Landscape an alerting check can be created for a MetricStream.
