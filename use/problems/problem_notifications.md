# Problem notifications

## Overview

Problems in StackState generate events that can be used to trigger event notifications. StackState v4.3 does not support notifications for problem events out of the box, however, the functionality to do this is included. You can [create your own custom event handler](/configure/topology/event-handlers.md#create-a-custom-event-handler-function) that will listen and react to the events generated by problems in your landscape.
