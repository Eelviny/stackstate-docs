# Problem notifications

## Overview

Problems in StackState generate events that can be used to trigger event notifications. StackState v4.3 does not support notifications for problem events out of the box, however, the functionality to do this is included. You can [create your own custom event handler](/configure/topology/event-handlers.md#create-a-custom-event-handler-function) that wil listen and react to the events generated by problems in your landscape.

## Events generated by problems

StackState will generate events tracking creation and changes in problems. These events are not listed in the Events Perspective, but can be used to trigger event notifications using a custom event handler.

| Event | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `Problem created` | A new problem has been created. |
| `Problem update` | New information is available for a problem. For example, a new root cause or contributing cause being added to the problem, or an update to a check on an existing unhealthy component. |
| `Problem subsumed` | A change in root cause has caused an existing problem to be [joined with another problem](#two-problems-one-root-cause). |
| `Problem resolved` | The root cause component and all contributing cause components have reported a CLEAR (green) health state. No unhealthy components remain in the problem. |
