# Template

Start with a brief intro explaining:
- What is this thing/concept? How does it fit into the StackState system
- Why would you use it? There may be different answers for different user types here, that can also be covered and link out to other content/actions as required


## Where

Needs a better title, obviously. This section is basically a UI manual. It describes where this thing/concept sits in the StackState UI and the elements that it controls and can control it.

![thing/concept where](/.gitbook/assets/basic_filtering_list.png)

Includes at least one screenshot that should be annotated to clearly show influence or the thing/concept.

## Actions

Instructions for completing all the relevant things a user can do with the thing/concept. Example below is taken from the Views page. For each, open with an intro line of why/when you would do this. These descriptions should remain simple and link out to more complex content if required.
