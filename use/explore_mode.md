# Explore mode

## Overview

The StackState explore mode gives you an unfiltered view of your topology. This is most likely a much larger overview that you would like to see at any given time, but is a good place to start creating [customized views](/use/views/README.md).

Up to 10,000 components can be displayed at any time, if there are already more items in your topology than this, you will need to [add a filter](#add-a-filter) before any data will be displayed.

## Perspectives

As in any StackState view, explore mode gives you access to data from your IT landscape in all available [StackState perspectives](/use/views/perspectives.md). Each perspective shows different data from the filtered (or unfiltered) components. Use the perspective buttons across the top of the screen to switch between them: 

* [Topology Perspective](/use/views/topology_perspective.md)
* [Telemetry Perspective](/use/views/telemetry_perspective.md)
* [Events Perspective](/use/views/events_perspective.md)
* [Traces Perspective](/use/views/traces_perspective.md)

## Add a filter

You can zoom in on a specific area of your IT landscape using basic filters by writing an advanced filter query. Click the **View Filters** icon on the left of the screen to open the View Filters pane. Read more about [filtering](/use/views/filters.md).  

## Save a view

When you change the displayed components using a filter, the **Save view** button will appear at the top of the screen. This allows you to save the applied filters and access them directly from the [Views](/use/views/README.md) menu.
