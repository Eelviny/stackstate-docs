# Events Perspective

The Events Perspective shows events and changes for the elements in the current [view](/use/views/README.md) or filtered topology.

## Events

StackState defines an event as a timestamped record of an activity or change that an observer of the platform should be aware of. Events help you make sense of changes that impact your IT landscape and are a great asset when troubleshooting problems. 

### Event source

StackState works with three different kinds of events, note that not all of these are available in the Events Perspective:

- **Internally generated events** - Events generated by StackState. The following event types will be listed in the Events Perspective: Anomaly, Component/relation created, Component/relation deleted, Component/relation updated, Health state changed, Version changed.
- **Events from external systems** - Some StackState integrations can retrieve events from external systems. All events retrieved from external systems will be listed in the Events Perspective.
- **Events telemetry streams** - Event data can be received through an events [telemetry stream](/configure/telemetry/checks_and_streams.md#data-streams). Events from these streams will not be listed in the Events Perspective, however, they can be monitored by a check. Checks can trigger a health state change event, which would be listed in the Events Perspective as an internally generated event.

### Event category

All events in StackState have a category assigned based on the event type and source system. The available categories are **Activities**, **Alerts**, **Anomalies**, **Changes** and **Others**. Events received from external systems will have a category attached to them when they arrive in StackState. If no valid category is included in an event, it will be grouped under the category **Others**. 

### Event properties

Click on an event to display an overview of the event details in the **Event properties** pane on the right of the screen. Events from external systems will also include links through to relevant information in the source system here:

- **Elements** - The components and/or relations involved in the event.
- **Event type** - A description of the event type.
- **Event time** - The time at which the event occurred. For events from an external system, this will be the timestamp from the external system. Click on the timestamp to [time travel](#time-travel) to the moment that the event occurred.
- **Processed time** - For external events, this is the time that the event was received by StackState. For internally generated events that affect the graph database, this is the time data was stored in the graph database. Click on the timestamp to [time travel](#time-travel) to the moment that the event was processed by StackState.
- **Links** - Direct links to an external source of an event. For example, a ServiceNow change request or JIRA ticket.
- **Description** - Additional information about the event. For example, the context of the event or its importance.
- **SHOW EVENT PROPERTIES** - Click to access all data included in the event.

## Filter displayed events

The events listed in the Events Perspective can be filtered in two ways: 

- Topology filters define the elements (components and relations) for which events will be displayed.
- Event filters refine events displayed based on type and tags. 

### Topology Filters

The elements (components and relations) included in a view are defined by the topology filters in the **View Filters** > **Topology Filters** pane on the left side of the screen. Only events relating to these elements or the view itself will be visible in the Events Perspective. You can [change the topology filters](/use/views/filters.md) at any time to list the events for a different set of elements. 

### Event filters

The events displayed in the Events Perspective can be filtered using the **View Filters** > **Filter Events** pane on the left side of the screen. Two filters are available to help you quickly locate relevant information:

| Filter | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Event Types** | Click on the **Event Types** filter box to open a list of all event types currently included in the Events Perspective. You can select one or more event types to refine the events displayed. |
| **Tags** | Relevant event properties will be added as tags when an event is retrieved from an external system. For example `status:open` or `status:production`. This can help to identify events relevant to a specific problem or environment.  |

### Time filter

Specify a time window to filter the events shown by time. Only events that occurred in the selected time window are listed. You can click on the playhead or timestamp to [time travel](#time-travel) to a point in history. 

## Time travel

The Events Perspective shows events matching the time window selected in the timeline control. 

- Shrink the time window to display less events. 
- Place the playhead on the timeline to display events generated by topology elements that existed at that moment in time.
- Click on a timestamp from the Event Properties to move the playhead directly to that point on the timeline. This will update the events list to display events that were generated:
    - by topology elements that existed at that moment in time.
    - within the specified time window adjusted to fit the timestamp.
