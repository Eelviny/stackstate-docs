# Events Perspective

The Events Perspective shows events and changes for the elements in the current [view](/use/views/README.md) or filtered topology.

## Events

StackState records changes in your landscape as **events**. Events help you make sense of the changes that impact your IT landscape and are a great asset when troubleshooting problems. 

### Event source

StackState works with three different kinds of events, note that not all of these are available in the Events Perspective:

- **Internally generated events** - Events generated by StackState. The following event types will be listed in the Events Perspective: Anomaly, Component/relation created, Component/relation deleted, Component/relation updated, Health state changed, Version changed.
- **Events from external systems** - Some StackState integrations can retrieve events from external systems. All events retrieved from external systems will be listed in the Events Perspective.
- **Events telemetry streams** - Event data can be received through an events telemetry stream. Events from these streams will not be listed in the Events Perspective, however, they can be monitored by a check. Checks can trigger a health state change event, which would be listed in the Events Perspective as an internally generated event.

### Event category

All events in StackState have a category assigned based on the event type and source system. The available categories are Activities, Alerts, Anomalies, Changes and Others. Events retrieved from external systems will have a category attached to them when they arrive in StackState. If no valid category is included in an event, it will be grouped under the category **Others**. 

### Event properties

Click on an event to display an overview of the event details in the **Event properties** pane on the right of the screen. Events from external systems will also include links through to relevant information in the source system here:

- **Elements** - The components and/or relations involved in the event.
- **Event type** - A description of the event type.
- **Event time** - The time at which the event occurred. For events from an external system, this will be the timestamp from the external system. Click on the timestamp to [time travel](#time-travel) to the moment that the event occurred.
- **Processed time** - The time the event was received by StackState. For internally generated events, this will be the same as the **event time**. Click on the timestamp to [time travel](#time-travel) to the moment that the event was processed by StackState.
- **SHOW EVENT PROPERTIES** - Click to access all data included in the event.

## Filter displayed events

The events listed in the Events Perspective can be filtered in two ways: 

- Topology filters define the elements (components and relations) for which events will be displayed.
- Event filters refine events displayed based on type and tags. 

### Topology Filters

The elements (components and relations) included in a view are defined by the topology filters in the **View Filters** > **Topology Filters** pane on the left side of the screen. Only events relating to these elements or the view itself will be visible in the Events Perspective. You can [change the topology filters](/use/views/filters.md) at any time to list the events for a different set of elements. 

### Event filters

The list of events displayed in the Events Perspective can be filtered using the **View Filters** > **Filter Events** pane on the left side of the screen. Two filters are available to help you quickly locate relevant information:

| Filter | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Event Types** | Click on the **Event Types** filter box to open a list of all event types currently included in the Events Perspective. You can select one or more event types to refine the events displayed. |
| **Tags** | Relevant event properties will be added as tags when an event is retrieved from an external system. For example `status:open` or `status:production`. This can help identify  events relevant to a specific problem or environment.  |

## Time travel

When opening the Events Perspective, the events shown are based on the currently selected time window in the timeline control. 

- Shrink the time window to display less events. 
- Place the playhead on the timeline to restrict the events to the time indicated by the playhead. 
- Click on a timestamp from the Event Properties to jump directly to that point on the timeline.
