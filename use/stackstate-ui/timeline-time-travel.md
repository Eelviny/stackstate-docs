# Timeline and time travel

## Overview

The timeline at the bottom of the StackState UI allows you to travel back in time to the state of the topology at a specific point in the past and zoom in or out on the displayed telemetry. Health and events charts in the timeline give an overview of the state of the topology in the selected telemetry interval.

## Timeline

### Health

The health state of a view over the selected telemetry interval is displayed as a colour in the **Health** line of the timeline. The health state is only available when:

* [Health state is enabled](/use/health-state/configure-view-health.md) for the current view.
* The topology displayed results from the original topology query saved in the view. If the applied topology filters have been edited, but not saved, no health state will be available for the edited selection.

When health state is not available, a gray line is displayed.

### Events

The **Events** line in the timeline shows a bar chart with the number of events that happened at each point in time. This helps you see moments in the past when a lot was happening with topology from the [selected topology time](#topology-time).

To zoom in on a bar showing a lot of events, click and drag to select a smaller time window around it.

{% hint style="info" %}
Clicking on the timeline will move the playhead to this point, and thus time travel the topology to the selected time. Only events generated by topology elements that were available at the selected topology time will now be displayed. The telemetry interval will remain unchanged.
{% endhint %}

## Time travel

StackState stores topology and telemetry from your landscape and allows you to time travel through these using the timeline. There are two types of time travel:

* Time travel through telemetry by setting a [telemetry interval](#telemetry-interval).
* Time travel through topology by setting a [topology time](#topology-time).

As the telemetry interval and topology time can be configured separately, it is possible to display for example events generated today by the topology elements deployed in the landscape as it was yesterday.

### Telemetry interval

The telemetry interval specifies the time window for which events, metrics and traces are displayed.
