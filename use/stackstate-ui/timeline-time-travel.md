# Timeline and time travel

## Overview

The timeline at the bottom of the StackState UI allows you to travel back in time to the state of the topology at a specific point in the past. You can then navigate through all telemetry available for the selected topology snapshot. Health and events charts in the timeline give an overview of the state of the topology during the selected telemetry interval.

## Timeline

### Telemetry interval

The telemetry interval specifies the time window for which events, metrics and traces are available in the StackState perspectives. The selected telemetry interval runs from left to right on the timeline. By default, the telemetry interval is set to a relative time interval showing telemetry from the last hour. You can zoom in/out or [time travel](#time-travel) to view telemetry from a specific point in time by setting a custom telemetry interval. 

{% hint style="info" %}
The telemetry interval can be a maximum 6 months. It does not need to include the currently selected topology time. If the telemetry interval does not include the topology time, the message `The topology time is out of the current time interval` will be displayed in the timeline.
{% endhint %}

The telemetry interval can be set in the following ways:

* Click and drag on the timeline to zoom in on a selection.
* Select a relative time window or set a custom time interval from the **Set the telemetry interval** popup on the left of the timeline.
* Use the time range arrow buttons to the left and right of the **Set the telemetry interval** popup to move the selected telemetry interval backwards or forwards through time.

If the end time of the selected telemetry interval is in the past, StackState will be in [time travel mode](#time-travel) and the [topology time](#topology-time) will be paused. Click **Go live** or **BACK TO LIVE** to stop time travelling and return to live mode.

### Topology time

The topology and all telemetry displayed in StackState is based on a snapshot of the IT infrastructure. The moment from which this snapshot is taken is specified by the topology time. 

By default, StackState is in live mode with the topology time set to the current time. You can [time travel](#time-travel) to a previous state of the topology by selecting a custom topology time. On the timeline, the selected topology time is shown by the playhead - a black line with the selected topology time at the top. It is also specified in the **Topology time** box at the top of the timeline. 

The topology time can be set in the following ways:

* Use the time range arrow buttons to the left and right of the **Topology time** box to move the playhead forwards or backwards in time to the next set of [events](#events).
* To move the playhead to a specific time, click on the timeline.

Click **Go live** or **BACK TO LIVE** to stop time travelling and return to live mode.

### Health

The health state of a view during the selected telemetry interval is displayed as a colour in the timeline **Health** line. 

Health state information is available when [health state is enabled](/use/health-state/configure-view-health.md) for the current view as long as the topology displayed results from the original topology filter saved in the view. If the topology filters have been edited and not saved, no health state information will be available.

When health state information is not available, a gray line is displayed.

### Events

The **Events** line in the timeline shows a bar chart with the number of events generated at each point in time. This helps you to see moments in the past with a lot of activity. Note that only events generated by topology elements that existed at the selected topology time are displayed.

To zoom in on an event bar of interest, click and drag to select a smaller telemetry interval around it on the timeline.

![Click and drag to select a telemetry interval](/.gitbook/assets/v44_timeline_click_drag_3.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
A single click on the timeline will move the playhead to this point in time, and thus time travel to the state of the topology at the selected time. Only events generated by topology elements that existed at the newly selected topology time will now be displayed.
{% endhint %}

## Time travel

In each of the StackState perspectives, you can either be in live mode or in the past. In live mode, StackState will constantly poll for new data. When you time travel through topology or telemetry, you are effectively working with a snapshot of your infrastructure. The data available is based on two selections:

* [Topology time](#topology-time) - a specific moment in time for which you want to fetch a snapshot of your IT infrastructure.
* [Telemetry interval](#telemetry-interval) - the time range for which you want to see telemetry and traces.

Let's imagine a concrete scenario:

* You received an event notification saying that your payment processing application is not able to process any payments right now, and your customers aren't being served.
* In StackState, you can go to the moment in time when the components that make up the critical path of payment processing turned to a CRITICAL state. That moment corresponds to the point in time for which you will fetch the snapshot of your IT infrastructure - the topology time.
* You can then select to see the hours that preceded that moment in order to fetch the telemetry that will hopefully point you to the root cause of your problem - the telemetry interval.

StackState will enter time travel mode whenever a custom topology time is selected, the **Pause** button is clicked, or a telemetry interval is set with an end time in the past. When StackState is in time travel mode: 

* You are effectively working with a snapshot of your infrastructure.
* Telemetry is available for components that were part of the topology at the selected topology time only.
* If a relative telemetry interval was selected in live mode, this is frozen as a custom time interval relative to the moment at which time travelling began.

Click **Go live** or **BACK TO LIVE** to stop time travelling and return to live mode.
