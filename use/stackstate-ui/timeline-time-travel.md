# Timeline and time travel

## Overview

The timeline at the bottom of the StackState UI allows you to travel back in time to the state of the topology at a specific point in the past. You can then navigate through all of the telemetry available for the selected topology snapshot. Health and events charts in the timeline give an overview of the state of the topology in the selected telemetry interval.

## Timeline

### Health

The health state of a view during the selected telemetry interval is displayed as a colour in the timeline **Health** line. 

Health state information is available when [health state is enabled](/use/health-state/configure-view-health.md) for the current view as long as the topology displayed results from the original topology filter saved in the view. If the topology filters have been edited and not saved, no health state information will be available.

When health state information is not available, a gray line is displayed.

### Events

The **Events** line in the timeline shows a bar chart with the number of events generated at each point in time. This helps you to see moments in the past with a lot of activity. Note that only events generated by topology elements that existed at the selected topology time are displayed.

To zoom in on an event bar of interest, click and drag to select a smaller time window around it on the timeline.

{% hint style="info" %}
A single click on the timeline will move the playhead to this point in time, and thus time travel to the state of the topology at the selected time. Only events generated by topology elements that existed at the newly selected topology time will now be displayed. The telemetry interval will remain unchanged.

## Time travel

StackState stores topology and telemetry from your landscape and allows you to time travel through these using the timeline. There are two types of time travel:

* Time travel through telemetry by setting a [telemetry interval](#telemetry-interval).
* Time travel through topology by setting a [topology time](#topology-time).

As the telemetry interval and topology time can be configured separately, it is possible to display for example events generated today by the topology elements deployed in the landscape as it was yesterday.

### Telemetry interval

The telemetry interval specifies the time window for which events, metrics and traces are displayed.
