description: Use StackState to detect anomalies in your IT infrastructure
---

## Overview

StackState can detect anomalies in your IT infrastructure in two ways:

- [Autonomously](#autonomous-anomaly-detection) based on machine learning models.
- Using configured metric [baselines](#anomaly-detection-with-baselines).

It is not possible to use autonomous and baseline anomaly detection at the same time for one metric stream. Any metric stream with a configured baseline will not be picked for anomaly detection by the Autonomous Anomaly detector.
