## Probable causes

For each reported problem, StackState will list all events that are likely to have contributed to the problem. These are all events of type **Version changed**, **Anomaly** or **Element properties changed** for components in the problem that occur within the problem time window. If no relevant events are available in StackState, this list will be empty.
