# Problem identification

## Overview

When a component or relation reports a DEVIATING (orange) or CRITICAL (red) state, StackState will identify this as a problem in your IT environment. As StackState is aware of the connections and dependencies between elements in the topology, related state changes can be grouped together into a single problem with a single root cause. This is helpful because it will:
 
 - **Speed up problem investigation** - all unhealthy elements in the landscape affected by a single root cause can be found in a single sub-view.
 - **Reduce noise** - the evolution of the whole problem can be be tracked as a single entity, rather than a collection of individual, unhealthy elements.
