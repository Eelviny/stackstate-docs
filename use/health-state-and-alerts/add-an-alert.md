# Add an alert

## Overview

StackState can be configured to send out alerts in response to changes in the health state. Event handlers assigned to a view will run when state change events are generated by the associated components/relations or the view itself. A number of event handlers are included out of the box, or you could create your own:

- **Email**: Send an email alert to a specified email address. Note that an [SMTP server must be configured](/configure/topology/configure-email-alerts.md) in StackState to send email alerts.
- **HTTP webhook POST**: Send an HTTP POST request to a specified URL.
- **Slack**: Send a notification to a specified Slack webhook URL.
- **SMS**: Send an SMS alert (MessageBird) to a specified phone number.

## Add an alert

To add an alert or automated action, add an event handler from the StackState UI Events Perspective.

1. Go to the [Events Perspective](/use/views/events_perspective.md).
2. Select **Events Settings** on the left.
3. Click **ADD EVENT HANDLER**.
4. Select the type of state changes that should trigger an alert or automated action:
    - **View state changes** - triggers only on a health state change of the entire view. Recommended to reduce noise.
    - **Own state changes** - triggers with every change to the own health state of a component or relation in the view.
    - **Propagated state changes** - triggers for every change to the propagated health state of a component or relation in the view. The propagated health state is calculated based on the componentâ€™s dependencies. Use to alert on potential impact.
5. Select the event handler function that should run whenever the selected event type is generated.
6. Enter the required details, these will vary according to the event handler function you have selected.
7. Click **SAVE**.
