# Add an alert

## Overview

StackState can be configured to send out alerts in response to changes in the health state. Event handlers assigned to a view will run when state change events are generated by the associated components/relations or the view itself. A number of event handlers are included out of the box, or you could create your own:

- **Email**: Send an email alert to a specified email address. Note that an [SMTP server must be configured](/configure/topology/configure-email-alerts.md) in StackState to send email alerts.
- **HTTP webhook POST**: Send an HTTP POST request to a specified URL.
- **Slack**: Send a notification to a specified Slack webhook URL.
- **SMS**: Send an SMS alert (MessageBird) to a specified phone number.

## Add an alert

To add an alert or automated action, add an event handler from the StackState UI Events Perspective.

![Add an event handler](/.gitbook/assets/event_handlers_tab.png)

1. Go to the [Events Perspective](/use/views/events_perspective.md).
2. Select **Events Settings** on the left.
3. Click **ADD EVENT HANDLER**.
4. Select the event handler function you wish to add.
5. Enter the required details, these will vary according to the type of event handler function you have selected.
6. Select the type of state changes that should trigger the selected event handler:
    - **View state changes** - trigger only on a health state change of the entire view (recommended to reduce noise).
    - **Own state changes** - trigger when the health state of a component/relation changes.
    - **Propagated state changes** - trigger whenever the propagated health state of a component/relation in the view changes.
7. Click **SAVE**.
