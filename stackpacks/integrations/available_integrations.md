# Available integrations

## Overview

StackState integrations are split into three groups, core integrations, curated integrations and community integrations.

## Core integrations

Core integrations are the main set of StackState integrations, covering cloud and container, ITSM, APM and log aggregation tools. These integrations are continuously updated and maintained by StackState. You will find them listed at the top of the **StackPacks** > **integrations** menu with a ðŸ’  icon next to the name.

## Curated integrations

Curated integrations are also developed and maintained by StackState, but are updated in response to feature requests or bugs raised. Documentation for curated integrations is available in the **StackPacks** > **integrations menu**.


## Community integrations

Community integrations are developed in response to specific customer requests. Documentation is available in the GitHub repo.
