# Available integrations

## Overview

StackState integrations are split into three groups:
 
* [StackState CORE integrations](#stackstate-core-integrations)
* [Curated integrations](#curated-integrations)
* [Community integrations](#community-integrations)

## StackState CORE integrations

Core integrations are the main set of StackState integrations. These integrations cover cloud and container, ITSM, APM and log aggregation tools. These integrations are continuously updated and maintained by StackState. You will find them listed at the top of the **StackPacks** > **integrations** menu with a ðŸ’  icon next to the name.

## Curated integrations

Curated integrations are developed and maintained by StackState. Updates are planned in response to feature requests or bugs raised. Documentation for curated integrations is available in the **StackPacks** > **integrations** menu, they are listed underneath the StackState CORE integrations.


## Community integrations

Community integrations are developed in response to specific customer requests. Documentation is available in the associated GitHub repo. You can submit updates to the integrations and their documentation by opening a pull request there.
