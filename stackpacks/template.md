# stackpack template

Start with an intro. Include a high level overview (diagram!!) of how the StackPack works and where it sits in the StackState ecosystem.

![Diagram](/.gitbook/assets/dummy-diagram.png)

Describe what happens in the diagram (data flow). This should cover the type of information it produces:

- topological components and relations
- metrics, events and traces

## Install

{% hint style="info" %}
To decide - Should all the page be included in the UI StackPack or should basic steps completed in UI be covered there and link out to docs for remaining? (e.g. include pre-requisites, install and uninstall only).
{% endhint %}

#### Pre-requisites

Networking requirements and pre-requisites should be named here. If there are none, also state that here.

#### Installation

The steps to taken to install. It's ok if that is just 'click to install', also name it here. If there is more than one step, write as a process of numbered steps.

## Configure

Extra steps that need to be carried out to activate the StackPack. This can be a collection of headings or actions. For example, from the [Google Analytics StackPack](/stackpacks/integrations/google_analytics.md) page:

### Common configuration

Parameters should be described in a table. If there are steps to follow number these as a process. Include an example.

### Core reporting API

Parameters should be described in a table. If there are steps to follow number these as a process. Include an example.

### Real-time reporting API

Parameters should be described in a table. If there are steps to follow number these as a process. Include an example.

### Google Analytics integration

Parameters should be described in a table. If there are steps to follow number these as a process. Include an example.

## Uninstall

If the uninstall includes manual or extra steps these should be included here. If it is a standard 'click to uninstall', also describe that here - don't leave the reader to guess.

## See also

End the page with pointers to relevant, further info. This might just be a list with any links already included in the page. If the StackPack is used in a tutorial, include that here.
